This is a little java program that counts the Lines of Code of a source file, with two options, the physical lines, i mean, all the lines of the document, including comments and void lines, by otherside, the LOC counts just the logical and meaningful lines.
The LOC/h to this little proyect, counting test and more, roound about 15 LOC/h

##  Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

---

##  Prerequisites

You will need the following installed on your system:

- [Java JDK 8+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html)
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Example for Debian/Ubuntu:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk maven git
---

For run the program you yust need to execute the comand mvn clean compile, and then, according to your needs:
## For Count physical lines:
java -cp target/classes edu.escuelaing.arsw.ASE.app.LineCounter phy src/main/java/edu/escuelaing/arsw/ASE/app/LineCounter.java

## For count logical lines:
java -cp target/classes edu.escuelaing.arsw.ASE.app.LineCounter loc src/main/java/edu/escuelaing/arsw/ASE/app/LineCounter.java

#  Running the test
For the tests, we have to tests files, Test1.java and Test2.java; Thanks to the tool junit, we runs 4 tests that shows the correct operation of the program.
Let's see throug the mvn test command:
